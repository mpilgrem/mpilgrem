I'm Mike Pilgrem (@mpilgrem).

My main coding interest is Haskell, the functional programming language. On
Hackage, I am a co-maintainer of the `RandomDotOrg`, `aeson-warning-parser`,†
`ansi-terminal`, `ansi-terminal-types`, `casa-client`,† `companion`,†
`crypton-conduit`,‡ `hi-file-parser`,† `hpack`,‡ `pantry`,† `rio-prettyprint`,†
`stack`† and `static-bytes`† packages. († indicates the history of the package
is directly connected with the Haskell Tool Stack (Stack) project. ‡ indicates
packages that are `stack` dependencies.) I am sole maintainer of the
`google-maps-geocoding` and `google-static-maps` packages.

I am a member of the `commercialhaskell` GitHub organisation.

I am an outside collaborator on the
`haskell/cabal`, `reanimate/reanimate` and `reanimate/reanimate-svg`
GitHub repositories.

I am a Windows user and interested in helping other Windows users use Haskell.

I am a director of the not-for-profit Haskell Foundation, which aims to promote
the language and support its users on all platforms.
