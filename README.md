I'm Mike Pilgrem (@mpilgrem).

My main coding interest is Haskell, the functional programming language. On Hackage, I am a co-maintainer of the `ansi-terminal` package. I am an outside collaborator on the `stack` and `pantry` respositories of `commericalhaskell`. I am interested in those respositories as a Windows user.
