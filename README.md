I'm Mike Pilgrem (@mpilgrem).

My main coding interest is Haskell, the functional programming language. On
Hackage, I am a co-maintainer of the `ansi-terminal` package. I am a member of the
`commercialhaskell` organisation, having previously been an outside collaborator
on its `stack`, `pantry` and `stackage-content` respositories. I am interested in
those respositories as a Windows user. I am also an outside collaborator on the
`haskell/cabal` respository.

I am also an outside collabotator on the `reanimate/reanimate` and
`reanimate/reanimate-svg` respositories. I am interested in helping Windows users
use those Haskell libraries.
